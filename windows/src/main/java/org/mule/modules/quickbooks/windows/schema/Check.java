 *         Description: Financial transaction representing a payment to a payee. The Check represents an expense to the business paid as a check transaction. The expense is of the following types: [li]Item based expense for the item that is purchased for reselling. [/li][li]Account based expense for the amount spend on an account, such as expense incurred on "advertisement expense" account.[/li]

 *         Product: QBW
 *         Description: Financial transaction representing a payment to a payee. When used together with a realm synchronized with a QuickBooks company, the IDS Check object maps to the QuickBooks Check. Upon synchronization with QuickBooks, the IDS Check Add operation results in a new Check added to the QuickBooks register. Check Add creates a Check similar to what a user might create in the QuickBooks "Write Checks" form. The Write Checks form can be reached in the QuickBooks UI by selecting Banking->Write Checks or by clicking on the Write Checks icon in the Home page. [br/] In the Check line items, you refer to an item via the ItemName field. That references automatically supplies the base unit of measure (UOM) for the item, and its description. You need only supply the quantity and unit price. At least one line item is required.
